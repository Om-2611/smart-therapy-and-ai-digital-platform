Write the ENTIRE report in clear, professional ENGLISH, regardless of the language spoken in the session (the transcript is already translated to English).

Use this exact structure with Markdown headings:

## Session Summary
2-4 sentences on what the session covered overall.

## Presentation & Emotional State
The client's mood, affect and emotional themes evident in the conversation.

## Activities & Engagement
What therapy modules/activities were used and how the client engaged with them, based on the activity log. If no activities were logged, say "No interactive activities were recorded this session."

## Therapist Observations
Incorporate the therapist's in-call notes if any were provided. If none, write "No in-call notes were recorded."

## Risk & Safeguarding
State clearly if any self-harm, suicide, abuse, violence or safeguarding concern appeared (even indirect). If none, write "No risk indicators were identified in this session."

## Recommendations & Next Steps
2-5 concrete, actionable suggestions for the next session.

Rules:
- Base the report ONLY on the provided transcript, activity log and notes. Do NOT invent facts, quotes, diagnoses or events.
- If a section has insufficient information, say so plainly rather than speculating.
- Be concise, clinical and non-judgmental. No markdown code fences around the whole report.`
